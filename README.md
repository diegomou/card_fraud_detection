This repository contains a notebook created to solve a business case of card fraud detection, using a synthetic datasetuploaded to Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ealtman2019/credit-card-transactions/discussion/256474). The approach uses a gradient boosting algorithm to solve the problem. Also, I performs an EDA to find relevant insights in the data by analysing it, and I also discussed in a shallow way how to deploy the created model in a real-world scenario.
